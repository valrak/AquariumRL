Aquarium arena roguelike game

You've been caught by merman civilization and thrown into their 
Aquarium Arena to entertain crowds. More you kill, more items
you can expect to fall into the arena. Especially when you keep that
combo meter active! Corals in the arena can be used to hide in them.

After certain amount of kills gate appears. When this happens, no items
are thrown to arena, only monsters are generated. Move through the gate
as soon as possible, as your score don't go up until you go to next level.
Bring gold to gate to raise your score.

You have also your trusty watch:
H is your current / maximum health.
S is your current score.
L is current level / amount of kills before gate appears.
C is combo meter.
W is current / maximum weight.

Good luck!
